## Introduction 
Catch the div is a game to exercise visual reflexes. The goal is to get the exact moment when two moving squares are aligned.   
This project is a revision about my first dev project just when I learned how powerful the DOM could be. Especially when combined with CSS to control styling.   
From a while, I has been waiting a free moment to refactor that code and apply the knowledge I has learn since that first project.
